# Introducing Myself

## The Basics
My name is Jordan Fletcher.
I am a Media Production major who's taking this course out of personal interest.
I'm a senior. This will be my last semester (fingers crossed), so I'm hoping to go out on a bang.

## What I Hope To Learn
I've never considered myself to be good with computers.
I'm looking forwad to building my understanding of how computers work.
Outside of class, I'd like to spend some time refining some of my projects from 120, if I have the time.

## Something Interesting
I'm a big reader, primarily in the fantasy genre.
I have a goal to read 52 books this year (about 1 every week). I got to 38 last year.

### Pseudocode for hello.py
userName gets input from 'What is your name?'  
print 'Hi, {userName}'  
if userName is 'Andy':  
	print 'I'm looking forward to this semester with you'  
create while keepGoing loop:  
	response gets input from 'Do you think I will do well in CS 121?'  
	if response starts with 'y':  
		print 'Thanks for the vote of confidence!'  
		loop ends  
	elif response starts with 'n':  
		print 'Honestly, that's fair.'  
		loop ends  
	else:  
		print 'I'm not sure I understand. Please respond with a 'yes' or 'no'.'  
		loop continues  
print 'Thanks for talking with me!'
